# nDEX
Next generation decentralized ethereum token exchange. Our primary goal is to provide a clean, fast and secure trading environment with lowest service charge. We believe community is power and for community satisfaction, we integrate a troll box on our DEX with 24/7 customer support executive. nDEX uses the cutting edge technology for fast and secure trading, deposit and withdraw process. In-house alpha testing and development is going on. Open beta for trader and testers will release on Q3 2018. If everything going perfect as according our plan we will live on end of Q3 2018. Exact time and date will announce on open beta testing phase. Major benefit for using nDEX is, every trader will get rebate in our native ERC20 token NDX every Sunday for a period of one year. For running this rebate ecosystem we will use 50% of our trading profit to buy back NDX from community. We will not use our reserve token for this anymore. Hope community will enjoy our platform and business model.

# NDX
The native utility token for nDEX. It is an ERC20 compatible token. Total supply 15 billion and its fixed. 3 billion NDX for company and team which are locked/stored a secure wallet for a period of six months. This stored/locked wallet id will post publicly. Community can always look up that wallet. After six months lockup period 2.5% token will release for distribution. Another 1.5 % token will be released for nDEX development expenditures. Well will publish our token and business profit-loss summary every end of quarter. 12 billion NDX will place for community seed funding purpose. On seed funding stage any unsold token will be airdropped to all donors. Rest of 1 billion NDX is used for airdrop, community building, marketing, advisers reward and donation bonus purposes.

# Contract address, community fund, reserve fund addresses will publish soon.


# Fundraising
As a start up we have done 50–60% task like rent a office, buying server, renting some service, hiring manpower and few some other jobs. We have done all these by our own finance. But for good token ecosystem a big exchange is most essential for its growth and adoption. To get listed on a major exchange its cost a decent amounts of money. Taking NDX a major part of our business goal, we decide to conduct a seed stage donation event. Our soft cap is 500 ETH. We dont need millions, we need our community. Our hard cap is 1000 ETH. If we success to raise these amounts, we believe NDX will be a known ERC20 token to majority of community.

# Donation and Rewards
For fundraising we are asking or request few donation on ETH which range 0.001 ETH — 0.1 ETH maximum at reward conversion rate of 10000000 NDX / 1 ETH. One single identity can donate maximum 0.1 ETH. If anyone can try more than 0.1 ETH transaction, it will automatically rejected by our smart contract. There is a bonus option for more than 0.050 ETH, if anyone donate more than 0.05 ETH but less than 0.1 ETH will get 5% more NDX within a period of maximum 48 hours. 10 billion tokens are allocated for seed funding via donation. After getting NDX anyone can transfer and trade on supported DEX. Our team will co-operate all about trading and transfer related support.

After concluding of seed stage we publish all details with transperency an trust. All unsold tokens will burn. Seed/donation funding stage will continue for a period of 30–45 days. It will not extend anymore. If we fail to reach our softcap 500 ETH, we promise to return everyones fund on due course.

# Exchange listing and Future
After conducting donation period, if everything goes well we will list our token on several major exchange within a short period of time. In future when EOS dapps are more available, we have a plan to integrate EOS tokens as well as Qtum. nDEX will be a multichain DEX in future and its utility token NDX gain much traction and value, which will bring a quality gain for early investor/donor.

# Please note, we are working hard behind the screen to live our website with MVP and whitepaper. Airdrop and fundraising going on same period but airdrop participant will get their token after 7 days ends of fundraising project. Donor will get their token instant via smart contract. And there is no token lock up period for donor and participants.
